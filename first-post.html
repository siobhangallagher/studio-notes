    <p>Welcome to <em>Studio Notes</em>! This space is part journal, part sketchbook. Here I’ll reflect on my creative process, share learnings from design and code, and document the quirks of navigating a career transition into tech.</p>

    <p>This first post is a small but important step in building my voice and showcasing my progress. Thanks for reading — there’s more to come!</p>
