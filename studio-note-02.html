      <p>
        Twenty years ago I studied marketing. I was fascinated by what
        influences us to choose one product over another. Working in FMCG
        sharpened that focus. I was hooked.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the time I was working at a unique location, with two big FMCG
        brands, Coca-Cola and Parmalat, that operated from the same depot. I was
        exposed to the power of brand equity and learned the art of packaging,
        placement, pricing, and advertising. I also worked with a Territory icon
        — Paul’s Iced Coffee — and witnessed brand loyalty at its finest. Loyal
        fans. Custom car cup holders made for the iconic 600mL milk carton.
        Marketing magic in motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then life happened, and my path shifted, from finance and banking to
        not-for-profits and government.
      </p>

      <p>
        But consumer behaviour never really left. It was always there in the
        background, quietly influencing how I approached problems. I just didn’t
        realise it at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good design, like good marketing, evokes emotion and memory. Whether
        it's a printed form for clients, a template for volunteer committees, or
        a sign-up page for a sustainability startup, the user is always at the
        heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        My grounding in marketing gives me a strategic edge in UX. I already
        think in terms of audience, outcomes, and influence. I’ve been
        translating human behaviour into design for years — just under a
        different name.
      </p>

      <p>
        My hobbies too, translate to UI. Knitting and calligraphy. The stitch
        pattern, symmetry, colour and typography. All of these elements can
        translate to the digital world — they are the aesthetic layer — the
        buttons, icons and layout that a user sees. The drape and fit of a
        garment, the fibre texture — the thoughtful and tactile digital
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>Turns out, I’ve been doing UX and UI all along.</p>

      <p>It’s just time for me to give it a new label.</p>
