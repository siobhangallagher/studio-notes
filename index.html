    <h1>✨ Studio Notes</h1>
    <p><strong>Studio Notes</strong> is my creative sandpit. A space for sketching thoughts, testing ideas, and documenting the squiggly path I'm taking as I transition into a career in UI/UX and tech. 🧩</p>
    <p> This isn't where polished work lives. This is the where I stay curious and be bold, writing about how design shapes our everyday lives, online and off. </p>
    <p> Like good design, this is all about the iteration. 💬🛠️</p>
